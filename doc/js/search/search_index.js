The exact method will be slightly\ndifferent for the root (top-level) module for which you should end up with the code similar to (notice MatProgressButtonsModule .forRoot()):\nimport { MatProgressButtonsModule } from 'mat-progress-buttons';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatProgressButtonsModule.forRoot(), ...],  \n  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}Other modules in your application can simply import MatProgressButtonsModule:\nimport { MatProgressButtonsModule } from 'mat-progress-buttons';\n\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [OtherComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatProgressButtonsModule, ...], \n})\nexport class OtherModule {\n}Usage\nSpinner Button\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { MatProgressButtonOptions } from 'mat-progress-buttons';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-home',\n  template: ''\n})\nexport class SomeComponent {\n\n  // Button Options\n  btnOpts: MatProgressButtonOptions = {\n    active: false,\n    text: 'Stroked Button',\n    spinnerSize: 19,\n    raised: false,\n    stroked: true,\n    flat: false,\n    fab: false,\n    buttonColor: 'accent',\n    spinnerColor: 'accent',\n    fullWidth: false,\n    disabled: false,\n    mode: 'indeterminate',\n    customClass: 'some-class',\n    // add an icon to the button\n    buttonIcon: {\n      fontSet: 'fa',\n      fontIcon: 'fa-heart',\n      inline: true\n    }\n  };\n\n  // Click handler\n  btnClick(): void {\n    this.btnOpts.active = true;\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      this.btnOpts.active = false;\n    }, 3350);\n  }\n};Spinner button FAB\nYou can use the spinner button with a mat-fab with an icon. Both mat-icon and font awesome are supported.\nTo set up fontawesome to work with mat-icon you can see instructions here\nUse the icon property on the options object\n  btnOpts: MatProgressButtonOptions = {\n    active: false,\n    text: 'Stroked Button',\n    spinnerSize: 19,\n    raised: false,\n    stroked: true,\n    flat: false,\n    fab: true, // set fab to true\n    buttonColor: 'accent',\n    spinnerColor: 'accent',\n    fullWidth: false,\n    disabled: false,\n    mode: 'indeterminate',\n    icon: {\n      color: primary,\n      fontSet: 'fa',\n      fontIcon: 'fa-save',\n      inline: true\n    },\n  };Icon API\ninterface MatProgressButtonIcon {\n  color?: ThemePalette; // icon color (primary or accent)\n  fontIcon?: string;    // name of the icon (for fontawsome, use 'fa-[icon_name])'\n  fontSet?: string;     // if using fontawesome, use 'fa' (omit for material icons)\n  inline?: boolean;     // automatically size the icon\n  svgIcon?: string;     // name of the icon in the SVG icon set.\n}More info in Angular Material Docs\nBar Button\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { MatProgressButtonOptions } from 'mat-progress-buttons';\n\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-home',\n  template: ''\n})\nexport class SomeComponent {\n\n  // Button Options\n  btnOpts: MatProgressButtonOptions = {\n    active: false,\n    text: 'Stroked Button',\n    buttonColor: 'accent',\n    barColor: 'accent',\n    raised: false,\n    stroked: true,\n    flat: false,\n    mode: 'indeterminate',\n    value: 0,\n    disabled: false,\n    customClass: 'some-class',\n    // add an icon to the button\n    buttonIcon: {\n      fontSet: 'fa',\n      fontIcon: 'fa-heart',\n      inline: true\n    }\n  };\n\n  // Click handler\n  btnClick(): void {\n    this.btnOpts.active = true;\n    setTimeout(() => {\n      this.btnOpts.active = false;\n    }, 3350);\n  }\n};Note: Bar Button does not suppor the fab style, currently.
